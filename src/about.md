Hi, I'm Hunter, But a Unique One! This is one of my many half-done projects that I'm having fun working on these days (Summer 2024).

Man, I love playing baseball games with simulation or RPG elements. I miss the MVP series, and The Show is fine, but is annoying in a bunch of ways. I've been learning, or trying to learn, Japanese for a long time, and I'm finally at the point where I can play games like Pro Yakyuu Spirits and Pawa Pros, though I'm still not that good with the dialogue and conversations. Anyway...

I wanted to use these games to practice and learn and improve my Japanese, so I started taking screen shots and transcribing the text to work with. Before I knew it, I had a lot of material, so I started this project in hopes that some other people would find it useful. I have no idea if I'm going to finish any of the modes or get to a point of completion for the materials for these games, but hopefully you can find something useful here. I'm trying to make it as organized as possible, but as I haven't played most of the modes to completion, some of the taxonomy of activities, screens, and dialogues may shift around a bit, or may just be badly organized forever.

Anyway, [go check out the games I'm playing and translating](/games)!
