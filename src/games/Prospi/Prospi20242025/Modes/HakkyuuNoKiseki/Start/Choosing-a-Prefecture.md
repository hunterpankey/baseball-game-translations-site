When you first start out in Hakkyuu no Kiseki mode, you're going to be asked what prefecture you want to start in. If you're already great at the game, this matters a little less than otherwise, but this prefecture choice will affect your game progression somewhat, as busier prefectures have more schools and teams, so you have to win a lot more games to get out of the prefectural tournament and make it to Koshien.

So the biggest tip here is: *If you want an easier route, choose a prefecture with fewer teams, and if you want more of a grind or challenge, choose a busier one.* I chose Aomori both because I like the area and think it's cool, and because it has a regular number of teams. Tokyo or Osaka would have been cool, but they have so many teams!

## Process
The first screen selecting locations is to select your general region. The selected region will be highlighted on the right side in the map. The status bar at the bottom states the selected region with the prefectures included, but if you're not reading kanji yet, this won't be much help. Here, I've highlighted Tohoku (東北地区) in the north.

Once you select the region, you select the actual prefecture you want to locate your school in. The path is easier if you're in a rural area because there are fewer schools competing for the prefectural slot to Koshien, and the prefectural tournament has fewer competitors as well. The Tokyo and Osaka areas are naturally the most competitive because they are the areas with the highest population density.

At the bottom of the prefecture selection screen, you'll see the name of the prefecture and the population in stars out of 10, as well as a population density category. Here, I've selected Aomori, the northernmost prefecture other than Hokkaido.
