Finally, in year 2 or 3, you'll be able to request a practice game from other schools instead of having to wait for them to ask you. Here's what that looks like.

## Requesting the Game
![Should I request a practice game?][1]
{% japanese %}練習試合を申し込んでみるか。{% endjapanese %}

Maybe I should request a practice game.

![Listing opponent schools][2]
{% japanese %}対戦相手の候補をリストアップしますね。{% endjapanese %}

I'll make a list of potential opponents.

## Failing to Schedule a Practice Game
![Choosing the school (none available)][3]
{% japanese %}＊練習試合は行わない<br />どの高校と練習試合をしますか？{% endjapanese %}

* No practice games will be held

Which high school will we play practice games against?

{% daisyAlert "Note: No schools were available when I tried this on July 26th. Oh well.", "error" %}

![No practice game after all][4]
{% japanese %}練習試合は行わないことにした。{% endjapanese %}

It was decided not to hold a practice game.

## Successfully Scheduling a Practice Game
In other instances, you'll be presented with a list of schools in image 3, with names and [fame levels](../../General/Lists/#fame-levels). You'll be able to pick from the list of three.
