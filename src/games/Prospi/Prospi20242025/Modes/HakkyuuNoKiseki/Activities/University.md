The university, that august institute of learning, is good for helping your players increase their academic ability. Players with higher academic abilities can read more books to improve their skills, but if their academic abilities are low, they'll fail their exams and have to take remedial classes, which makes them get sad and play worse.

## Visiting the University

{% japanese %}大学の近くに来た。<br />
このあたりは野球部ＯＢの大学生が多いところだ。

I went to the university. There are a bunch of former baseball club students here.

![2][2]
{% japanese %}久しぶりに野球部ＯＢに会うと、後輩たちの進路について熱心に話し出した。今でも気にかけてくれているようだ。{% endjapanese %}

When I met up with an alumnus for the first time in a long time, he began to talk enthusiastically about the future of his juniors. It looks like he still cares about them.

![3][3]
{% japanese %}後輩たちのためにと私に預けて去っていった。{% endjapanese %}

He left it in my care, saying that it would be for the younger generation, and then he left.

![4][4]
{% japanese %}参考書を入手した。<br />
参考書を入手した。<br />
参考書を入手した。{% endjapanese %}
