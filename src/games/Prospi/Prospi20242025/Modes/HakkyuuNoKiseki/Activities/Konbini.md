Here's the activity to go to the convenience store after unlocking it with a graduating player.

## Possible Outcomes
- Getting Items - You could buy some stuff and successfully have them added to the Items screen in the smartphone, like energy drinks.
- Improving Player Moods (shown below) - You could buy some stuff and then your players could steal them for themselves.

## Standard Dialog
The following two screens of dialog should be the same for each of the convenience store instances.

> I decided to go out to the convenience store. It was a store where a former player was working.

> I hadn't seen him in a long time, but he told me about a recommended product.

## Variable Dialog
The following screens of dialog will vary based on which product the game randomized for you.

> I decided to buy the recommended snacks/candy. ...But, unfortunately the players suddenly stuffed them into their stomacks.

> Sugisaki (line 1) and Fukushima's (3) mood became good. Yuasa's (2) mood became normal.

I got some candy/snacks, but these rascals ate them all. At least their moods improved as a result.
