The hospital activity, as you might imagine, will give you some access to fatigue relief.

## Going to the Hospital
![1][1]
{% japanese %}病院に来た。<br />ここは野球部 OB の元マネージャーも勤めている病院だ。{% endjapanese %}

I went to the hospital. This is the hospital where a former player from the baseball club works.

{% japanese %}久しぶりに出会うと、<br />
体のメンテナンスについて詳しく教えてくれた。{% endjapanese %}

When we met again after such a long time, he gave me detailed information about taking care of my body.

The OB doctor gives us some tips, and he promises to come see us sometimes. When he visits, the club members will recover from their fatigue.

![3][3]
{% japanese %}
色々話しているうちに、<br />
このあと野球部のみんなに<br />
特別に指導してくれることになった。
{% endjapanese %}

As we were talking, we arranged for him to give special instruction to the whole baseball team.

## Results

![4][4]
{% japanese %}
かなり入念に指導してくれたみたいで、<br />
みんな日頃の疲れが取れて上機嫌だ。
{% endjapanese %}

It seems like he gave us a very thorough instruction, and everyone was in a good mood, having recovered from their daily fatigue.

{% japanese %}
鵜飼の体力が回復した。<br />
鵜飼のテンションがノリノリになった！<br />
今関の体力が回復した。
{% endjapanese %}

Ukai's stamina has recovered.
Ukai's excitement is high!
Imaseki's stamina has recovered.
