The Yorozuya shop is one of the best places to get items to help your team. You can get training equipment to increase your grounds level, books and equipment to apply to players, and other good stuff. Here's what that activity looks like.

## Before Shopping
![1][1]
{% japanese %}こうにゆうYorozuyaでアイテムを購入しよう。Yorozuya（よろず屋）はネットショップだ。<br />
(ピピピッ)
{% endjapanese %}

Let's buy some goods from Yorozuya. Yorozuya is an online shop.
(beep beep)

![2][2]
{% japanese %}それでは早速アイテムを購入するか。{% endjapanese %}

So, should we go shopping now?

## Shopping
At this point, you'll be presented with the list of goods available for purchase. The list changes every time you go to the shop, and the things you see this time probably won't be there next time. Some store this is!!

You'll be shopping with the PP that you earn from victory. There is no other currency that you can spend here, so if you don't have much to spend, it's probably not worth burning the activity slot on it.

Select items with X, which will deduct from your PP wallet in the top-right. It doesn't actually purchase until you use the button in the top left, so you can select various combinations and let the game do the math for you. Use the reset button (「{% jisho "レセット" %}」) to unselect everything and start over.

## After Shopping
Goods are shipped directly to the club room immediately. There's no shipping delay or anything, so you don't have to wait until next week or anything, other than the usual post-activity time cycle. (So I guess you do technically wait until the next activity period...)

Also, it seems like your club manager who receives the package suspects you of being some kind of deviant. 

![3][3]
{% japanese "太田　美南" %}
あ、バーン監督！<br />
さきほど監督宛に何やら荷物が届いていましたよ。
{% endjapanese %}

**(Club Manager) Ota Minami:** Oh, Director Baun! 
A package just arrived addressed to you.

{# ![4][4] #}
{% japanese "太田　美南" %}
まさか怪しいものじゃないですよね?<br />
（ジーーーッ）
{% endjapanese %}

**Ota:** Surely that's not something shady, is it? (Zzz...)

{% daisyAlert 'Note: I think that "zzz" is more like sucking your teeth in suspicion.', "info" %}

## Receiving the Goods

![5][5]
{% japanese %}(まさか、こんなに早く届くとは・・・）{% endjapanese %}

(I never thought it would arrive so soon...)

{% daisyAlert 'Note: It arrives this soon every time. Get with the program, computer-me...', "info" %}

![6][6]
{% japanese %}ヨガマットを入手した。<br />
変化球ＤＶＤを入手した。{% endjapanese %}

I got a yoga mat. 
I got the DVD about breaking pitches.

{% daisyAlert 'Note: Google Translate called this a "Curvature DVD", which I think is something else entirely.', "info" %}
