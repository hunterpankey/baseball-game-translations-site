Constant practice and games will wear your players out and lead to less effective practices and worse performances. This is one of the main ways to manage your players' fatigue levels, along with improving players' fatigue recovery attributes ({% jishoSearch "体力回復" %}), and giving them stamina drinks.

As fatigue levels elevate:
- Energy ({% jisho "体力" %}) will decrease, so both the improvement from your general weekly practice will go down, but also your activity card selections will yield worse benefits.
- Moods will decrease gradually, meaning worse game performances.

## Outcomes
- Several players energy levels ({% jishoSearch "体力回復" %}) will improve.

## Dialog
The following two screens of dialog should be the same for each of the convenience store instances.

> I decided to give a break from practice and allow the players to rest and recover.

![Players are happy](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Activities/Day-Off/day-off-dialog-2.png)
> Everyone is happy to have a while off from practice.
