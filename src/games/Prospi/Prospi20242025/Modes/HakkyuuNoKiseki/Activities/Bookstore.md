Here's how it goes when you choose to go to the bookstore after unlocking it with a graduating player.

## Possible Outcomes
- Buying Books - You might buy a book or some books which you can then apply to a player for some benefit associated with the book in question.

## Standard Dialog
The following two screens of dialog should be constant when you go to the bookstore.

![Going to the bookstore](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Activities/Bookstore/bookstore-activity-1.png)
> I decided to go out to the bookstore. It's a bookstore where a former player works.

![Retired player recommends a book to us](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Activities/Bookstore/bookstore-activity-2.png)
> Maybe he was bored, but he kept pushing a recommendation...

## Variable Dialog
The following screens of dialog will vary based on which book the game randomized for you.

![Using a coupon for a book](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Activities/Bookstore/bookstore-activity-3.png)
> By coincidence, I had a book token, so I decided to purchase a book with it.

![Receiving a book](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Activities/Bookstore/bookstore-activity-4.png)
> I acquired the Book of Motivation.

This book is the Book of Motivation. I can apply this to a player to improve them.
