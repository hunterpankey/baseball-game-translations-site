One of the best practice activities is the Red-White Game, which what an intrasquad game is called in Japan. Rather than focusing on a single practice aspect, like pitcher stamina or power hitting, this activity will improve all aspects of your players.

## Holding the Game

We decided to conduct training in a realistic game environment by holding a red vs. white game.

![Everybody is playing hard][2]
{% japanese %}みんなハッラッとプレーしている!{% endjapanese %}

Everybody is playing hard!

## Results

After this, you'll see the standard attribute increase pings for the increases. A nice result is 8-9 attribute points, but you might get less in the rain, or if players are tired, etc.
