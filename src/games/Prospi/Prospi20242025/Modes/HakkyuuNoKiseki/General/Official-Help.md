The system icon in the in-game smartphone has a help option. Below is the translated text of all 35 topics. There are many more details not covered in the official help, some of which is covered in other pages. Links are added to sections to those other pages where applicable.

*Note: The game calls the individual practice cards "Command Icons". I should have adopted that name, but it seemed like a bad name for them, so elsewhere in this site, you'll see the term "Activity Card". They're the same thing.*

## About Game Progress
画面下に表示されるコマンドアイコンを複数選択し、実行することで 7 日間の日程が進行します。
Select multiple command icons (*activity cards*) at the bottom of the screen and execute them to progress through the seven-day schedule.

（試合や入学式などは強制的に日程進行が止まるため、必す7日進行するわけではありません）
(The schedule will not necessarily progress over seven days, as events such as games and entrance ceremonies will force the schedule to stop.)

また、一部のコマンドアイコンは特定の条件によって強制的にシャッフルされ入れ替わる場合があります。
In addition, some command icons may be forcibly shuffled and swapped under certain conditions.

*See also: [Selecting and Executing Practices](../../General/Practicing/#selecting-and-executing-practices)*

## Command Icon Marks
「:musical_note:」や「ドクロ」などのマークが付いているコマンドアイコンを実行すると、しゅうりようじターン終了時にイベントが発生します。
When you execute a command icon marked with a "music note" or "skull" mark, an event will occur at the end of your final turn.

「:musical_note:」マークは何か良いことが発生、「ドクロ」マークは何か悪いことが発生、「緑」マークは体力回復イベントが発生し、
A "music note" mark means something good will happen, a "skull" mark means something bad will happen, a "green" mark means a stamina recovery event will occur,

黄色の「↑」マークはイベントは発生しませんが、そのときに選んだ練習コマンドアイコンの効果が高くなります。
A yellow "↑" mark means no event will occur, but the effect of the practice command icon selected at the time will be increased.

## Command Icon Sets
同じ練習コマンドアイコンを複数セットすることで、練習効率が高くなります。
Setting multiple practice command icons of the same color will increase the efficiency of your practice.

また、同時にセットされる数が増えるほどさらに練習効率を上げることが出来ます。
The more practice command icons you set at the same time, the further you can increase your practice efficiency.

また、同じ色の練習系コマンドアイコンを複数セットすると、それぞれ練習効率がちょっぴりアップします。
Also, setting multiple practice command icons of the same color will slightly increase the efficiency of each.

例えば「素振り」と「腕立て」は別の練習ですが、コマンドアイコンの下地の色が同じなので「素振り」と「腕立て」の両方が若干強化されます。
For example, "practice swing" and "push ups" are different exercises, but because the background color of the command icons is the same, both "practice swing" and "push ups" will be slightly strengthened.

*See also: [Doubles and Triples](../../General/Practicing/#doubles-and-triples)*

## About Cost
コマンドアイコンにはコストが設定されており、コストが高いほど効果が高く選択実行することでコストが消費されます。
Command icons have an associated cost; the higher the cost, the more effective the icon is, and the cost is consumed by selecting and executing it.

また、コマンドアイコンそのものに対しコストが決まっているわけではなく、アイコンの表示位置によりコストが決まっています。
In addition, the cost of the command icon itself is not fixed, but rather is determined by the icon's display position.

画面の右側のものほどコストが高く、画面の左側のものほどコストが低くなります。
(使用していないものはターン経過により左に移動)
The more to the right of the screen, the higher the cost, and the more to the left of the screen, the lower the cost. 
(Unused icons move to the left as turns pass.)

ターンが経過すると、ほんの少しだけ残りコストが回復します。
As turns pass, a small amount of the remaining cost will be restored.

*See also: [Card Cost](../../General/Practicing/#card-cost)*

## Increasing Effectiveness
コマンドアイコンには使用順により、アイコンの効果が強化されるなど、何らかの効果が得られるものがあります。
Depending on the order in which you use command icons, the order in which you use them can have some effect, such as strengthening the icon's effect.

例えば、「練習休み」の直後に「特訓」をした時などです。この場合は特訓の成功確率が上がります。
For example, if you do "Special Training" immediately after a "Practice Break/Rest" command. In this case, the success rate of the special training increases.

他にもいくつかのバターンが存在します。色 々 探しながら試してみましよう。
There are several other patterns as well. Try them out and see what you find.

*See also: [Card Combinations and Sequences](../../General/Practicing/#card-combinations-and-sequences)*

## Checking Growth Reports
メイン進行画面で🛆ボタンを押すと直前のコマンドアイコン実行からの成長データを確認することができます。
Press the 🛆 button on the main progress screen to check the growth data from the previous command icon execution.

## Individual Practice Instructions
「データ」→「選手情報」から選手個人に対し練習指示ができます。
You can give training instructions to individual players from "Data" → "Player Information".

選手は練習系コマンドアイコンの実行や試合、イベントなど色んなシーンで経験値を入手しますが、
Players can gain experience points in various situations, such as executing training command icons, playing in games, and events,

個別練習指示により設定された内容は常に練習している状態となり、コマンド実行後に経験値を入手できます。
but the content set by individual training instructions will always put the player in a practicing state, and they can gain experience points after executing the command.

*See also: [Training Settings](../../General/#training-settings)*

## Practice Equipment and Durability
練習器材を使用することでグラウンドレベルが上がりレベルの高い練習系コマンドアイコンが出現&実行できるようになります。
By using practice equipment, the ground level will increase, and higher level practice command icons will appear and be able to be executed.

練習器材には耐久度があり、練習系のコマンドアイコンを実行するたびにれつか少しすっ劣化していきます。
Practice equipment has durability, and each time a practice command icon is executed, it will deteriorate slightly.

耐久度が 0 になると練習器材が壊れてグラウンドレベルは下がり、その練習系コマンドアイコンはできなくなります。
When the durability reaches 0, the practice equipment will break, the ground level will decrease, and that practice command icon will no longer be available.

ただし、同じ練習器材を複数所持している場合は、練習器材が壊れたときには自動的に使用され、グラウンドレベルはキープされます。
However, if you have additional pieces of the same practice equipment, they will be automatically used when it breaks, and the ground level will be kept.

練習器材の耐久度は、「データ」→「アイテム」→「練習設備」で確認することができます。(丸いアイコンは耐久度を表します)
You can check the durability of practice equipment by going to "Data" → "Items" → "Practice Facilities". (The round icon indicates durability)

また、練習系コマンドアイコンを選択中にも上記と同じ丸いアイコンにより耐久度を確認できます。
You can also check the durability of a practice command icon by finding the same round icon above it.

練習器材の耐久度についてはアイテム「メンテナンスキット」を使うことで、練習器材の耐久度を回復させることが可能です。
You can restore the durability of practice equipment by using the item "Maintenance Kit".

## How to Use Items
アイテムには複数の種類があります。
There are several types of items.

「練習器材」系のアイテムは使用することでグラウンドレベルが上がり、対象の練習系コマンドアイコンがレベルアップします。
Using a "practice equipment" item will raise the ground level and the relevant practice command icon will level up.

「パワーバット」や「走カスパイク」などの「野球道具」系アイテムは1 選手につき最大 1 回までしか使用できません。
"Baseball equipment" items such as "Power Bat" and "Running Spikes" can only be used a maximum of once per player.

また、「アベレージヒッターの本」や「奪三振の本」といった「特殊能力の本」系アイテムは 1 選手につき使用できる回数が、選手の学力により決まります。
Also, the number of times that "Special Ability Book" items such as "Average Hitter Book" and "Strikeout Book" can be used per player is determined by the player's academic ability.

他にもアイテムには色んな種類のものがありますが、個人に対して使用するものやチーム全体に対して使用するものなど様 々 です。
There are various other types of items, some of which are used on individuals and some on the whole team.

アイテムは、コマンドアイコンの「Yorozuya (よろす屋)」から購入することが可能です。
Items can be purchased from the command icon "Yorozuya".

アイテム購入のために必要な戦績ポイントは試合をすることで入手することができます。
The points needed to purchase items can be obtained by playing matches.

*See also: [Items](../../General/Items/)*

## School Registration Settings
登録設定ではユニフォームや校章など色んなものを自分好みに設定することが可能です。(「データ」→「登録設定」から設定-編集可能)
In the registration settings, you can customize various things such as uniforms and school emblems to your liking. (You can edit the settings from "Data" → "Registration Settings")

また、ライバル校の校名やユニフォームも編集することができます。(「データ」→「ライバル校情報」→「編集」)
You can also edit the school name and uniform of rival schools. ("Data" → "Rival School Information" → "Edit")

*See also: [Smartphone](../../General/Dashboard-Smartphone/#smartphone)*

## Town Development
卒業式が終わると、街の情報が更新されます。
Once the graduation ceremony is over, the town information will be updated.

1 つの施設につき登録人数が 1 人以上いるとその施設がコマンドアイコンとして登場するようになります。
When there is at least one person registered for each facility, that facility will appear as a command icon.

また、登録人数が増えるほど各施設のレベルが上がり、コマンドアイコンの効果は高くなります。(「Yorozuya (よろす屋)」は除く)
Also, the more people registered, the higher the level of each facility will be, and the more effective the command icon will be. (Excluding "Yorozuya")

「データ」→「街の情報」で確認できます。
You can check this by going to "Data" → "Town Information".

*See also: [Town Updates](../../Monthly/March/Graduation-Ceremony/#town-updates)*

## Gameplay Styles
試合では色んなプレイスタイルが用意されていて、プレイヤーは自由に試合形式を選ぶことができます。
There are various play styles available in the game, and players can freely choose the game format.

戦術試合、チームプレイ、フィールドプレイ、試合観戦、自動試合、結果へ（試合スキップ）など
Tactical match, team play, field play, game spectating, automatic match, to results (skip game), etc.

戦術試合では選手に指示を出す試合形式、チームプレイやフィールドプレイでは自らアクション操作をする試合形式になります。
In tactical matches, you give instructions to the players, while in team play and field play, you control the actions yourself.

*See also: [Gameplay Modes](../../Gameplay/Sim-Rules/#gameplay-modes))*

## Game Strategy Mode
戦術試合は戦術力ードで選手に指示を出すことで試合を行います。アクション要素はありません。
In tactical games, you play by issuing instructions to players using tactical cards. There are no direct action cards.

戦術力ードには基本戦術力ードと固有戦術力ードが存在し、基本戦術力ードを選ぶことで試合が進みます。
There are basic and unique tactical cards, and the game progresses by selecting one of the basic tactical cards.

基本戦術力ードは数字が大きいほど成功しやすく、固有戦術力ードは 1 選手につき 1 試合で1 回しか使えない強力な戦術力ードです。
The higher the basic tactical card's number, the more likely it is to succeed, and unique tactical cards are powerful cards that can only be used once per player per game.

固有戦術力ードの内容は選手の性格により決まります。
The content of the unique tactical cards is determined by the player's personality.

*See also: [Tactical Mode](../../Gameplay/Sim-Rules/#tactical-mode)*

## Team Play Mode
チームプレイ（ダイジェスト）は通常の対戦同様に全選手のアクション操作で試合を行います。（操作機会はおまかせ）
In team play (digest), you control all players' actions in the same way as in a normal match. (Control opportunities are left to the discretion of the player)

試合では難易度の変更が可能です。（ルーキー、ノーマル、エキスパートから選択可能）
You can change the difficulty level during the match. (You can choose from Rookie, Normal, and Expert)

*See also: [Team Play Mode](../../Gameplay/Sim-Rules/#team-play-mode)*

## Field Play Mode
フィールドプレイは特定の選手１人を指定しその選手のみのアクション操作で試合を行います。（操作機会は自分好みに変更可能）
In field play, you select one specific player and play the game using only that player's actions. (You can change the control opportunities to suit your tastes.)

試合では難易度の変更が可能です。（ルーキー、ノーマル、エキスパートから選択可能）
You can change the difficulty level during the game. (You can choose from Rookie, Normal, and Expert.)

*See also: [Field Play Mode](../../Gameplay/Sim-Rules/#field-play-mode)*

## Opposing Batter Information
打者には得意-不得意コースがあります。
Each opposing batter has strong and weak spots.

初めて対戦する打者の得意・不得意コースは試合開始時には不明ですが、試合を続けていく中で少しすっ判明していきます。
When you face a batter for the first time, you won't know their strong and weak spots at the start of the game, but as the game continues, this will become clearer.

相手打者が苦手なコースを狙うと、打ち取りやすくなります。
If you aim for the batter's weak spots, it will be easier to strike them out.

*See also: [Throwing a Pitch](../../Gameplay/During-a-Game/#throwing-a-pitch)*

## In-Game Messengers
ベンチの選手を伝令に出すことでその場面で有利な効果を得ることができます。(「タイム」→「伝令」→選手を指定)
By sending a bench player as a messenger, you can gain advantageous effects in that situation. ("Time" → "Messenger" → Select a player)

１試合につき攻撃で３回、守備で３回使用可能ですが、１度伝令に出した選手を再び伝令に出すことはできません。
You can use a bench player three times in offense and three times in defense per game, but once a player has been sent as a messenger, they cannot be sent as a messenger again.

また、延長ではそれまでの伝令の使用回数に関係なく、１イニングごとに攻撃で１回、守備で１回すっ使用可能となります。
In extra innings, regardless of the number of times a messenger has been used up to that point, a player can be used once in offense and once in defense per inning.

伝令の種類は選手の性格により決まり、伝令の効果は学年が高いほど強くなります。
The type of messenger is determined by the player's personality, and the higher the school year, the stronger the effect of the messenger.

*See also: [Messengers and In-Game Coaching](../../General/#messengers-and-in-game-coaching)*

## Mercy Rule and Called Games
５~６回に１０点以上、７回以降に７点以上の差がつけばコールドゲーム成立で試合終了です。
If the score is 10 or more points in the 5th or 6th inning, or 7 or more points after the 7th inning, a "called game" is declared and the game ends.

ただし、甲子園大会や都道府県大会決勝、地区大会決勝、秋の全国大会決勝ではコールドゲームは存在しません。
However, there are no called games in the Koshien Tournament, prefectural tournament finals, regional tournament finals, or fall national tournament finals.

## Extra Innings Tiebreakers
延長試合や引き分け再試合による負担を減らし、決着がつきやすいように一時的にルールが変更されるのがタイプレークです。
Tiebreaks are a temporary rule change that reduces the burden of extra innings and rematches after ties, making it easier to reach a decision.

タイプレークが採用される公式戦では延長１０回以降になると無死一・ニ塁から試合が始まります。
In official games where tiebreak is used, the game will start with no outs and runners on first and second base after the 10th inning.

※ただし秋の全国大会の決勝戦ではタイプレークは採用されません。
* However, tiebreak will not be used in the finals of the autumn national tournament.

## Player Reliability and Trust
選手を試合に使い続けることでしんらい選手との間に信頼が生まれます。これを表したものを信頼度と呼びます。
By continuing to use a player in matches, trust is built between players. This is expressed as "reliability".

戦術試合において、信頼度が高いほど基本戦術力ードの数字が大きくなりやすく、その結果、戦術が成功しやすくなります。
In tactical matches, the higher the reliability, the higher the basic tactical numbers will be, and as a result, the more likely the tactics will be successful.

*See also: [Player Reliability](../../General/#player-reliability-(%E4%BF%A1%E9%A0%BC%E5%BA%A6))*

## Scout Evaluation
試合で活躍することでスカウトの評価が上がり、プロ野球選手への道が開けます。（評価が高いほどドラフトで指名されやすい）
By doing well in games, scouts' appraisal of players will increase, paving the way to becoming a professional baseball player. (The higher the evaluation, the more likely the player will be drafted.)

ただし、評価が高いと必すプロ入りできる訳ではなく学校の評判によりプロ入りの最大人数が決まります。（弱小=１人、そこそこ=２人、中堅=３人・・・）
However, having a high evaluation does not necessarily mean that the player will be able to go pro, and the maximum number of players who can go pro is determined by the school's reputation. (Weak = 1 person, Average = 2 people, Mid-level = 3 people, etc.)

また、スカウトの評価が高くなると選手には称号が付きます。
Also, as the scouts' evaluation of a player increases, the player will be given a title.

## Tactical Mode Help Buttons
戦術試合では戦術力ードを選択時に（right touchpad）“ボタンで各戦術力ードの詳細説明を確認できます。
In tactical matches, when you select a tactical card, you can view a detailed explanation of each card by pressing the right touchpad button.

## Player Development in Games
基本的には個別練習指示の設定内容で成長しますが、その他に試合中の行動や起用方法がえいきよう選手の成長に大きく影響を与えています。
Basically, players grow according to the choices of their individual training instructions, but their actions during games and how they are used also have a big impact on their growth.

例えば戦術試合の場合、「当てていけ」ならミートが上がりやすく、きようしんだげき「強振打撃」ならパワーが上がりやすくなります。
For example, in tactical games, if you use contact cards, you're more likely to improve your contact, while if you use the power hit cards, you're more likely to improve your power attribute.

また、チームプレイやフィールドプレイの場合なら「ミート打ち」ならミートが上がりやすく、「強振打ち」ならパワーが上がりやすくなります。
Also, in team play or field play, if you use contact swings, you're more likely to improve your contact, while if you use power swings, you're more likely to improve your power.

どちらのプレイスタイルでも共通しているのが起用による成長です。
例えば代走起用なら走力に影響するといった具合です。
One thing that both play styles have in common is growth through how you are used.
For example, a player being used as a pinch runner will affect their running ability.

試合では勝つだけでなく選手の成長のためにどんな行動をとればいいのか意識しながらプレイすることが重要になります。
In games, it's important not only to win, but also to play while considering what actions you should take to improve your players' growth.

## About Player Mood/Tension
選手にはそれぞれテンションが設定されていて、テンションが高いほど試合で好調や絶好調になりやすく、
Each player has a mood status; the higher the mood, the more likely they are to perform well or at their best in a game,

テンションが低くなると試合で不調や絶不調になりやすくなります。
and the lower the mood, the more likely they are to perform poorly or terribly in a game.

また、テンションが「超ノリノリ」になると特訓で特殊能力を習得しやすくなったり、試合や練習、イベント等で経験値を多く入手できます。
Also, when a player's mood is "super high," it becomes easier to acquire special abilities through special training, and they can gain a lot of experience points in matches, practice, events, etc.

## Red-White Intrasquad Games
紅白に別れて実戦形式のトレーニングを行い、各自のスキルアップに励みます。また、特殊能力を習得できる場合があります。
The team will split into red and white teams and train in a realistic game setting to improve their skills. They may also acquire special abilities.

*See also: [Red-White Game](../../Activities/Red-White-Game)*

## Spectate Game Command
他チームの試合を観戦し、各自のスキルアップを図ります。また、大幅に成長できる場合があります。
By watching other teams' games, you can improve your skills and potentially make big improvements.

## Special Training Command
特殊能力習得のための特訓を受けさせます。(レアリティの高い特殊能力ほど☆の表示数が多く、習得が難しくなります)
This command gives your players special training to learn special abilities. (The rarer the special ability, the more stars it has, and the more difficult it is to learn).

テンションが超ノリノリのときや、体力が多いとき、コマンドアイコンのコストが高いときには特殊能力を習得しやすくなります。
Special abilities are easier to learn when you're in high spirits, have a lot of stamina, or have a high command icon cost.

また、監督が選手に教えられる特殊能力は、イベントや試合を経験することで徐々に増えていきます。
The number of special abilities that the manager can teach to players will gradually increase as they experience events and matches.

*See also: [Manager's Training Skills](../../General/Manager-Training-Skills/)*

## Yorozuya Command
Yorozuya（よろす屋）は白球のキセキ専用のショップです。
Yorozuya is a shop exclusively in White Ball Miracle mode (Hakkyuu no Kiseki mode).

戦績ポイントを消費することでアイテムを購入することができます。
（戦績ポイントは試合により稼ぐことができます）
You can purchase items by spending match points.
(Match points can be earned by playing games)

また、商品ラインナップは毎回変わり、時々割引されていることもあります。
The available products change every time, and items are sometimes discounted.

Yorozuya（よろす屋）のレベルが上がることで商品のラインナップ数が増えていきます。
As Yorozuya's level increases, the number of products in the lineup will increase.

*See also: [Yorozuya](../../Activities/Yorozuya)*

## Player Scouting Command
全国各地に将来有望な中学生をスカウトしに行くことができます。成功すると、翌年 4 月に野球部に入部します。
You can go all over the country to scout promising junior high school students. If you're successful, they'll join the baseball club in April of the following year.

学校の評判が高くなるとスカウト可能な地域が増え、スカウトできる回数や選手の人数も増えます。
As your school's reputation improves, the number of areas you can scout will increase, and so will the number of times and thus, the number of players you can scout.

評判がそこそこ以上かつ１１月１日~２月末日になると選手スカウトが可能です。
（上記以外の期間には選手スカウトはできません）
If your school's reputation is above average, you can scout players between November 1st and the end of February.
(You cannot scout players during any other period.)

*See also: [Winter Scouting](../../Monthly/November/Winter-Scouting)*

## Schedule Review Command
スケジュールの見直しにより、コマンドアイコンが全てシャッフルされ、他のコマンドアイコンと入れ替わります。
The schedule review command causes all command icons to be shuffled and replaced with other command icons.

また、シャッフル後は練習系コマンドアイコンが最低 1 枚以上が保証され、強化された状態になります。
After the shuffle, you will be guaranteed to have at least one practice command icon, and they will be in a stronger state.

*See also: [Schedule Improvement](../../Activities/Schedule-Improvement)*

## Study Session Command
勉強により生徒たちの学力を上げることができます。また、信頼度アップや体力回復の効果もあります。
Studying can improve the academic ability of students. It also has the effect of increasing reliability and recovering stamina.

*See also: [Study Hall](../../Activities/Study-Hall)*

## Rest Command
練習を休むことで体力を回復させることができます。また、進行日数が多いほど効果が高くなります。
Taking a break from practice will help you recover your strength. The more days you take off from practice, the greater the effect.

*See also: [Day Off](../../Activities/Day-Off)*

## Practice Game Command
複数の対戦相手候補から、相手を選んで練習試合をすることができます。（次の日曜日に練習試合の日程が設定されます）
You can choose from multiple opponents to play a practice match. (The practice match will be scheduled for the following Sunday.)

公式戦に比べ得られる経験値や戦績ポイントは少ないですが、リスクのない試合を行えます。
You can play a practice match without risk, although you will gain less experience and points compared to an official match.

年間に最大５試合まで行うことができます。また、公式戦の大会期間中や練習試合禁止期間（１２月１日~２月末）には設定できません。
You can play up to 5 practice games per year. Also, you cannot play a practice game during official tournament periods or during practice game ban periods (December 1st to the end of February).

*See also: [Requesting a Practice Game](../../Activities/Requesting-a-Practice-Game)*

## Manager Command
現在のマネージャーによるイベントが発生します。また、各マネージャーごとに特徴があり、イベントの内容や効果が変わります。
Events will occur depending on the current manager. Also, each manager has their own characteristics, and the content and effects of the events will vary.

## Town Facility Commands
街の施設に卒業生が登録されることで、街の施設の各施設ごとのコマンドが出現するようになります。
By [registering graduates](../../Monthly/March/Graduation-Ceremony/#town-updates) in town facilities, commands for each town facility will become available.

（例:卒業生がコンビニに1人就職するとコンビニ（Lv. 1）が街の施設として登録される）「データ」→「街の情報」から確認できます。
(For example, if one graduate gets a job at a convenience store, a convenience store (Lv. 1) will be registered as a town facility.) You can check this by going to "Data" → "Town Info."

街の施設には球場、コンピニ、本屋、スポーツ店、ホームセンター、病院、ビジネス街、スポーツジム、大学など色んなものがあります。
Town facilities include a variety of things, such as the [baseball stadium](../../Activities/Stadium), [convenience store](../../Activities/Konbini), [bookstore](../../Activities/Bookstore), [sports shop](../../Activities/Sports-Store), [home center](../../Activities/Home-Center), [hospital](../../Activities/Hospital), business district, sports gym, and [university](../../Activities/University).

各街の施設ごとに専用のイベントが発生します。また、各施設のレベルが高いほどイベントの効果が高くなります。
Special events will occur for each town facility. Also, the higher the level of each facility, the greater the effect of the events.
