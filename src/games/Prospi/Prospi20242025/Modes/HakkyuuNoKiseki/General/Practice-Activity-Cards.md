<article class="prose max-w-xl lg:max-w-4xl lg:prose-lg">
This is an incomplete list, and the on-field attributes have multiple levels of training, affected by whether a piece of equipment is purchased and active in the grounds. For each attribute, e.g., stamina recovery or batting contact, you can have up to two pieces of equipment. No equipment is a level 1 practice (the default), one piece of equipment is a level 2 practice, and two pieces of equipment is a level 3 practice.

In the list below, the stretching activity is listed as a **level 3** practice because I have a **yoga mat** and a **medicine ball** active. If one were to wear and break, stretching activities from then on would become level 2 practices until a new second piece of equipment in that category were added.
