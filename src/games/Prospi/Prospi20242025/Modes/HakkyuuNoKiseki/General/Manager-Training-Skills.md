## Mechanics
The skills listed below can be learned by you as director, and can be taught to individual players through special training. They can also be learned semi-randomly as events or in-game. Some of these are one-time learnings, i.e., once you teach it to a player, they have that skill forever. Others have levels, like Quick to the Plate or Injury Resistance. You can teach those multiple times to level them up, and in the case of injury resistance at least, events can level them down.

## Skills
You might see 「教えられる特殊能力」 or parts of it in menus and other screens as in the manager listing shown below. This translates to "Special skills that can be taught".
