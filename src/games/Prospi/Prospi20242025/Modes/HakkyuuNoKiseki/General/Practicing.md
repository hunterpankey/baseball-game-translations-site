## Selecting and Executing Practices

![Main dashboard bottom practice selections](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/General/main-dashboard-bottom.png)
You'll pick practice and other activities from the bottom of the dashboard screen shown above. When there is a set event during a week, you'll select practices for the period from today until the next event, and results will be generally proportionally scaled to the amount of time in the period, i.e., if the period is two days because there's a game two days from now, you'll see about 2/7ths of the normal progression.)

From left to right, the cards shown above translate to:
1. Throwing check - improves throwing
2. Schedule improvement - reshuffles the cards and turns bad outcomes into good ones
3. Glove skills ("catch ball") - Improves fielding skills for {% jisho "捕球" %}
4. Practice swings - improves batting contact
5. Glove skills - note the extra border around the two of these, and the two repeats at the end
6. Study hall - improves scholarship allowing for more books and skills to be learned by players
7. Dumbbells - improves power
8. Dumbbells
9. Convenience store - visit the convenience store and get some items like energy drinks

Above the cards is a short message describing it. The highlighted one says, 「{% jisho "送球チェックをします。スローイング" %} :arrow_up: 」, which is really not an improvement over what's on the card, but if you hit Start/Option, it'll give you an even better description.

In any given period, you'll can select three activities (five during special training camps), with varying effects. Select them with X, and once you've selected three cards, press X again to execute. Practice cards improve the skills noted. There are a bunch of non-practice cards as well:
* The schedule improvement card makes the activities better, either by making them more effective, canceling any negative effects (the skull icons by the cards), or buffing a card to a positive effect (music note or upward arrow icon).
* The study hall improves players scholarship levels, so they pass their classes and don't have to stress about remedial classes, and they can have more books and skills applied to them to improve skills.
* The convenience store card lets you visit one of your former players who now works at the convenience store, and it gives you some items, like an energy drink to raise player stamina. Other location cards exist: university, sports store, home improvement store, stadium, etc., with similar benefits relating to the location
* The day-off card cancels practice for the day, raising players' general stamina, which improves future practices. Playing this card before a practice card in the set of three gives an additional bonus.
* The manager card lets you tell the club manager to clean up the club room (possibly finding an item like a baseball card to give to a player), tend to the grounds (to level it up and make practice more effective), or a couple of other actions.

The card cost is shown below the card. You can select cards that total equal to or less than the remaining cost for the period (see the top-right section above). Your team will recover a certain cost at the end of the period, less than the total amount, so if you spend all the remaining cost, next period will start with some amount below the max cost. So be careful about how you spend the points and budget a little bit so you don't run low when you need them.

Selecting the three activity cards will remove them from the collection. Additionally, the remaining card furthest to the left will be discarded. Remaining cards will move to the left and become less costly as well as less effective. New cards will be dealt in from the right.


Players will level up an actual full point if they fill their point meter via that activity. Even if a player doesn't get a point from the activity, they're still getting benefits, just not enough this time to score the next point in the skill. You can see the improvement in the smartphone roster screen's player details for the skill.
