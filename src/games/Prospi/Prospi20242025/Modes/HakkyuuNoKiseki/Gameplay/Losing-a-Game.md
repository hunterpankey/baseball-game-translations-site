You're not gonna win 'em all, not unless you're save-scumming pretty hard. So get used to it, especially in the beginning. You might win one or two games as an E-ranked school, but you'll go up against a C-ranked opponent and get wrecked soon enough. Tournaments are all single-elimination, single-game rounds. There's no loser's bracket that you can rise up out of in this game.

## Immediately After
![Game loss card](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Gameplay/Losing-a-Game/game-loss-card.png)

This is the card shown when you lose a game. Obviously, you'll see your own school logo instead of mine. The word is {% jisho "敗北" %}, which means "defeat" or "loss". If this was a tournament game, you're knocked out of the tournament and you'll lose out on the player development benefits of playing in additional games. If this is a practice game, this kinda doesn't matter.

Early on, after winning a game or two in the prefectural tournaments, the next goal will be winning enough games in the prefectural tournament, or becoming the tournament champion that you gain an entry to the regional tournament. My school is in Aomori, which has enough teams such that the prefectural tournament takes six wins. My most recent 2026 season saw me as the runner-up, which is still good enough to make the regional, so a loss doesn't always end your season.

## Dialog
Here's the chat you have with your club manager afterward. My tourney run was successful enough to make it into the regional as the third screen shows. You might see a differenc sequence if you get knocked out earlier, or if this was a practice game outside of a tournament.

![Oh no, we lost!](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Gameplay/Losing-a-Game/game-loss-dialog-1.png)
> We lost! That's too bad...

![The opponent was tough!](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Gameplay/Losing-a-Game/game-loss-dialog-2.png)
> We really wanted to win, even though the opponent was the better team today.

![But we're going to the regional tournament anyway](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Gameplay/Losing-a-Game/game-loss-dialog-3.png)
> We're already confirmed for the regional tournament, so we'll repay this loss when we get there.

## Results
Even when you lose, there are some benefits:
- First, you'll earn some PP that you can spend at the Yotsuya store. 
- And second, in this case, as manager, I learned something from watching one of the opposing players, so from this point forward, when I do the specialized training activity, I can choose it to teach my players.

> The team lost, and their run in the prefectural tournament came to an end.

> We earned 300 PP.

![Opponent had an amazing player](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Gameplay/Losing-a-Game/game-loss-dialog-6.png)
> Izumi, from our opponents Kuroishi Agricultural HS, was amazing. I'll make a note of him before I forget.

![I learned something from him](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Gameplay/Losing-a-Game/game-loss-dialog-7.png)
> I took notes on Izumi's play and got a book on power distribution

![New teaching ability](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Gameplay/Losing-a-Game/game-loss-dialog-8.png)
> I gained an understanding of power distribution. I'm now able to teach power distribution.
