## Gameplay Modes

There are two gameplay modes where you'll actually see some on-field action, Field Play and Team Play.

![play type selection menu](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Gameplay/Playing-Games/play-type.png)

The options above in order are:
* Tactical Mode ({% jishoSearch "戦術試合" %}) - the tactical card version, see details below
* Team Play Mode (Digest) (チームプレイ（ダイジェスト）) - regular game play, see details below
* Field Play Mode (フィールドプレイ) - regular game play for a player of your choosing, see details below
* Watch Mode ({% jishoSearch "試合観戦" %}) - watch the CPU play as both teams
* Automatic Play ({% jishoSearch "自動試合" %}) - sim the whole game with opportunities to make substitutions
* Skip and Sim the Whole Game ({% jishoSearch "試合結果へ" %}) - skip straight to the end

### Tactical Mode

![description of how to play the tactical mode](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Gameplay/Playing-Games/tactical-play-sim-rules.png)

More to come on this, but essentially, instead of directly controlling players, you set tactics like "work the inside corner" or "hit to the opposite field", and the CPU controlled players do the actual playing. There are special tactics cards that your players may have giving them an advantage for an at bat or a whole inning.

If there's a possibility of a mercy rule ("called game", {% jisho "コールド試合" %}) being called, you'll get to play those situations. So you can either close out a blowout win or save yourself by scoring a couple of runs and keeping the game alive.

#### Offense
You will play in the following situations:

* 1st-4th Innings - Any bases loaded situations ({% jisho "満塁" %}).
* 5th-7th Innings - Any situation with runners in scoring position ({% jisho "得点圏" %}).
* 8th Inning - Any situation with runners on base ({% jishoSearch "ランナーが出たら" %}).
* 9th or Later Inning
  * When ahead ({% jishoSearch "勝っている" %}) - Any situation with runners on base
  * When tied ({% jisho "同点" %}) or behind ({% jishoSearch "負けている" %}) - From the start of the inning

#### Defense

* 1st-5th Innings - Any bases loaded situations ({% jisho "満塁" %}).
* 6th-8th Innings - Any situation with runners in scoring position ({% jisho "得点圏" %}).
* 9th or Later Inning
  * When ahead ({% jishoSearch "勝っている" %}) or tied ({% jisho "同点" %}) - From the start of the inning
  * When behind ({% jishoSearch "負けている" %}) - Any situation with runners on base


### Team Play Mode

![description of how to play the team play mode](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Gameplay/Playing-Games/team-play-sim-rules.png)

In Team Play Mode, you'll play certain parts of the game, and the CPU will simulate parts of the game, depending on the current game situation. Exactly when you'll play is described above and translated below. The left side shows offense situations and the right side shows defense.

Regardless of being home or visitor, if you score an unspecified certain number of runs, the remainder of the game will simulate. Also, this mode has a mercy rule of 10 runs in the 5th and 6th innings, and 7 runs after the 7th or later. If there's a possibility of a mercy rule ("called game", {% jisho "コールド試合" %}) being called, you'll get to play those situations. So you can either close out a blowout win or save yourself by scoring a couple of runs and keeping the game alive.

#### Offense
You will play in the following situations:

* 1st Inning - The whole inning up to 3 runs scored, at which point the CPU will take over (and run the offense straight into the ground, if experience is anything to go by).
* 2nd-4th Innings - Any bases loaded situations ({% jisho "満塁" %}).
* 5th-7th Innings - Any situation with runners in scoring position ({% jisho "得点圏" %}).
* 8th Inning - Any situation with runners on base ({% jishoSearch "ランナーが出たら" %}).
* 9th or Later Inning
  * When ahead ({% jishoSearch "勝っている" %}) - Any situation with runners on base
  * When tied ({% jisho "同点" %}) or behind ({% jishoSearch "負けている" %}) - From the start of the inning

#### Defense

* 1st Inning - The whole inning up to 3 runs allowed, at which point the CPU will take over.
* 2nd-5th Innings - Any bases loaded situations ({% jisho "満塁" %}).
* 6th-8th Innings - Any situation with runners in scoring position ({% jisho "得点圏" %}).
* 9th or Later Inning
  * When ahead ({% jishoSearch "勝っている" %}) or tied ({% jisho "同点" %}) - From the start of the inning
  * When behind ({% jishoSearch "負けている" %}) - Any situation with runners on base

#### Field Play Mode
![field play logo](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Gameplay/Playing-Games/field-play-logo.png =150x150)

![field play settings](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Gameplay/Playing-Games/field-play-settings.png)

In field play mode, you'll choose a player from your lineup to play as. By default, you'll play all at bats, baserunning, fielding, pitching, etc. as your chosen player.
