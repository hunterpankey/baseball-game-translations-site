<article class="prose max-w-xl lg:max-w-4xl lg:prose-lg">

There are several tournaments to play in throughout the year. Your school will always play in the prefectural tournament for your prefecture, and if you finish high enough, you'll make the regional tournament from there. In Aomori, if I finish in the top two of the prefectural tournament, I make the regional tournament. If I'm the prefectural tournament champion, then I'm automatcally in the upcoming Koshien tournament as well. Regional tournament champions in the summer are invited to the national tournament at Meiji Jingu in the autumn. 

So, doing well in the prefectural tournaments is really the key to driving success for your school. Poor finishes in the prefectural tournaments mean that you don't even get the opportunity to participate in the other tournaments, which means less game participation growth for your players.

## Calendar

A couple of weeks before the start of a tournament, the selection day will occur. This is noted with the phrase, 「{% jishoSearch "組み合わせ抽選" %}」, which means (aproximately), "matchup lottery". This is where the official tournament bracket will be set. There's not much fanfare around it other than a couple of screens of dialog, but after the selection, you'll be able to go to the smartphone's calendar, press square, and see the bracket itself. After playing in a few tournaments, you'll start to see the same schools a few times and get to know them, and the other schools will appear in the rivals screen in the smartphone for you to prepare for.

## Before Selection

### Dialog
![tournament draw is imminent][1]

{% japanese %}もうすぐ春の地区大会の組合せ抽選会だ。{% endjapanese %}

The draw for the spring regional tournament is coming up soon.

![reminder to decide on the starting lineup][2]
{% japanese "太田　美南" %}監督！<br />

The spring regional tournament is fast approaching, so it's time to decide on the team members!

## Selection Day

![tournament draw date card][3]

Tournament matchup lottery

### Dialog

![tournament draw was held][4]
{% japanese %}春の地区大会の組合せ抽選か行われた。{% endjapanese %}

The draw for the spring regional tournament has been held.

![first game information][5]
{% japanese %}初戦は５月２０日（水）の第２試合対戦相手は新庄高校（山形）に決まった。{% endjapanese %}

The first match will be on Wednesday, May 20th, in the 2nd game of the day, and the opponent will be Shinjo High School (Yamagata prefecture).

![players are excited][6]
{% japanese %}対戦相手が決まり、選手みんなに気合が入った。{% endjapanese %}

Now that the opponent has been determined, the players got fired up.

![players mood increases][7]
{% japanese %}湯浅のテンションがノリノリになった！<br />
田畑のテンションがノリノリになった！<br />
野村のテンションがふつうになった。{% endjapanese %}

Yuasa's mood has improved!
Tabata's mood has improved!
Nomura's mood has returned to normal.

![practice efficiency is improved][8]
{% japanese %}練習効率が上がった。数日の間、練習効果が高くなります。{% endjapanese %}

Practice efficiency has improved. Practice will be more effective for several days.

![how to see the bracket][9]
{% japanese %}「データ」→「日程」から組合せ情報(トーナメント表)を確認することができます。{% endjapanese %}

You can check the matchup information (tournament table) by going to "Data" → "Schedule."

## Checking the Tournament Bracket
Once you're back to the dashboard, you can see the actual bracket from the smartphone's calendar screen. From the calendar, press square to show the bracket. Your school will be highlighted with a light background. As the tournament progresses, this bracket will update with game scores, and eliminated schools will be noted. You can use this to prepare for upcoming games by checking the remaining teams against the Rivals screen from the smartphone.

![tournament bracket showing us at the bottom][10]

## Not Selected for Tournament
Especially in the first couple of years, your school won't be strong enough to participate in many tournaments. When you're not selected, you'll see something similar to the following couple of screens.

![11][11]
{% japanese %}もうすぐ舂の甲子園大会の組合せ抽選会だ。{% endjapanese %}

The draw for the Koshien Tournament will be held soon.

![12][12]
{% japanese %}来年こそは出場資格を獲得し甲子園の土を踏みたい。{% endjapanese %}

Next year, we hope to qualify and step onto the soil of Koshien.

## Tournament Travel
Koshien (Kobe) and the national tournament (Tokyo) are further away from your home prefecture and require travel to get there for the duration of the tournament. You'll see a day note that reads 「移動」 for the travel day, and a few things will change while you're on-site:
- All of the local activities won't be available, so you can't go to the sports store, the gym, the hospital, etc., because you're not in town to go there.
- Practice equipment durability will not decrease while you're at the tournament.

The prefectural and regional tournaments don't require travel, so the above does not apply for those.

## Playing Games
The tournament games will take place throughout the next couple of weeks. The dashboard screen shows the next 10 or so days after today, and days with games will have the round number indicated to the right side of the day. Practice periods will automatically break on days that you have a game, so you'll have a number of shortened practice periods when the tournaement games are frequent.

See the following pages for actual game day guides:
- [Playing Games](../Playing-Games)
- [During a Game](../During-a-Game)
- [Postgame Victory](../Postgame)
- [Postgame Loss](../Losing-a-Game)
- [Simulation Rules](../Sim-Rules)

All tournaments are single-elimination, so losing a game means that you're out of the tournament.

## Winning a Tournament
After a while, your school will be strong enough on the field that you'll win a tournament, or at least get far enough to advance to the next tournament. For example, just by making the prefectural tournament final, you'll be able to play in the regional tournament. Winning the spring or summer prefectural tournament will get you into the next Koshien tournament.

![13][13]
{% japanese %}春の県大会で上位２チームが確定し、地区大会への出場が決まった。{% endjapanese %}

The final two teams were determined for the spring prefectural tournament, and they will advance to the regional tournament.
