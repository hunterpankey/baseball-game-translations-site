There are several tournaments to play in throughout the year. Your school will always play in the prefectural tournament for your prefecture, and if you finish high enough, you'll make the regional tournament from there. In Aomori, if I finish in the top two of the prefectural tournament, I make the regional tournament. If I'm the prefectural tournament champion, then I'm automatcally in the upcoming Koshien tournament as well. Regional tournament champions in the summer are invited to the national tournament at Meiji Jingu in the autumn. 

So, doing well in the prefectural tournaments is really the key to driving success for your school. Poor finishes in the prefectural tournaments mean that you don't even get the opportunity to participate in the other tournaments, which means less game participation growth for your players.

## Calendar

A couple of weeks before the start of a tournament, the selection day will occur. This is noted with the phrase, 「{% jishoSearch "組み合わせ抽選" %}」, which means (aproximately), "matchup lottery". This is where the official tournament bracket will be set. There's not much fanfare around it other than a couple of screens of dialog, but after the selection, you'll be able to go to the smartphone's calendar, press square, and see the bracket itself. After playing in a few tournaments, you'll start to see the same schools a few times and get to know them, and the other schools will appear in the rivals screen in the smartphone for you to prepare for.

## Checking the Tournament Bracket
Once you're back to the dashboard, you can see the actual bracket from the smartphone's calendar screen. From the calendar, press square to show the bracket. Your school will be highlighted with a light background. As the tournament progresses, this bracket will update with game scores, and eliminated schools will be noted. You can use this to prepare for upcoming games by checking the remaining teams against the Rivals screen from the smartphone.
