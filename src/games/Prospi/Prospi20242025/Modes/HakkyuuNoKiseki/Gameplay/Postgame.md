There is a lot of information available about the game you just played in the postgame screens. First though:

## Victory
![1][1]
We won the game! Hooray!

![2][2]
Here's the basic line score with a few details below:
* Winning Pitcher ({% jisho "勝利投手" %}) - Fukushima, 11-1 career record
* Losing Pitcher ({% jisho "敗戦投手" %}) - Morimoto, 9-6 career record
* Home Runs - for me - Yuasa: 1st HR, Kitakata: 3rd HR, Nomura: 9th HR, Okudaira: 3rd HR

If you pick the button for your team, you'll see a similar screen to the below.

## Details
![3][3]
Here's the play-by-play for the offense. The number column ({% jisho "評価" %}) is the overall game score for the player. More hits means a higher game score. The leftmost column is the starting position of the player.

The main purpose of this screen is to show you the sequence of plays. Let's take the first inning, for example. The sequence is:
* Single to LF ({% jishoSearch "左ヒット" %})
* HR to left ({% jisho "左" %})
* Flyout to center ({% jisho "中フライ" %})
* Single to LF ({% jisho "左ヒット" %})
* HR to right ({% jisho "左" %})
* Error by 3B ({% jisho "左エラー" %})
* Hit to center ({% jisho "左ヒット" %})
* Double play ({% jisho "併殺打" %})

That's a good inning! You can see small dots to represent RBIs on a play as well. 

### Box Score
![4][4]
Next is the traditional box score. Columns in order are: at bats/plate appearances, hits, doubles, triples, HR, RBI, strikeouts, walks, sacrifices, steals, double plays, times reached on error, and season/school yeah, year batting average. Totals are at the bottom, and the overall game batting average is shown.

![5][5]
Here's the pitching half of the box score. Columns in order are: IP, batters faced, pitches thrown, hits allowed, strikeouts, walks, earned runs (or maybe just all runs), unearned runs, wild pitches, HR allowed, ERA.

### Pitching Details
![6][6]
Here's where it gets interesting. The right side shows every pitch you threw in the game along with icon type for the pitch type. The color shows the result of the pitch: green is swing-and-miss ({% jisho "空振" %}), blue is in-play for an out (or error, sac fly, etc. Basically any ball in play that's not a hit), red is a base hit, and white is taken pitches. This is a good breakdown. Pound the zone with strikes but stay out of the center and try not to hang anything slow up in the zone.

Along the top, you have filters for all pitches ({% jisho "全て" %}), first pitches of ABs ({% jisho "初級" %}), swings and misses ({% jishoSearch "空振りさせた" %}), strikeout pitches ({% jishoSearch "三振を取った" %}), pitches they put in play ({% jisho "打ち取った", "打ちとった" %}), pitches they got a base hit on ({% jishoSearch "安打を打たれた" %}), and pitches they hit for a HR ({% jishoSearch "本塁打を打たれた" %}).

Below on the left side, you can see the breakdown of pitch types: 33 fastballs, 37 breaking balls, 24% best pitch percentage (2nd tap on the white line while delivering a pitch), and one bad pitch (pitches with a missed 2nd tap and a  "!" icon). Below that is the specific breakdown of breaking balls: 10 curve-type pitches (down-left) and 27 split/forkball-type pitches (straight down).

### School Fame/Renown
![7][7]
When you beat a team, you get a little bit of fame for your school. Beating better teams with a higher fame rank than you will get you a bigger increase. Ranking up your school's fame level means more recruits, better recruits, more scouting opportunities, higher grounds levels, etc. If you lose a game, your fame goes down some amount that depends on your relative ranks. Lots of benefits to higher fame ranks, so winning games is key!

## Returning to the Dashboard
### Player Growth
![8][8]
When you leave the field, you'll see all the specific point growth for your players. Here, my 2B gained a point of defense ({% jisho "守備" %}), my 3B went up a point in contact vs. righties ({% jishoSearch "対右ミート" %}), etc.

### Dialog
![9][9]
Then, your club manager wants to congratulate you. Here, she says that our opponents were a team that we definitely couldn't afford to lose to, and we didn't!

![10][10]
Then she says that we have to keep it up and do our best!

### Game Notifications
![11][11]
The game tells us that we've advanced past the quarterfinals.

![12][12]
We're awarded 500P to spend at Yotsuya.

![13][13]
Then I as manager made some notes about a quality player that we just played against, which became a book that I can apply to a player.

![14][14]
We quietly make our notes...

![15][15]
And the game gives us the book to apply and the skill that we can teach.

![16][16]
Then, one of our players got a new nickname for themselves. When a player's fame or maybe their scout appraisal rating goes up, they get awarded with a title/nickname. This time, Yuasa got the "Burning Man of Aomori" title.

![17][17]
And finally, the manager explains that Yuasa's fame has increased. It doesn't explicitly say that the scout rating has increased, but that's basically what has happened.
