When your drafted players graduate, they'll become available in other modes, like Star Player, as long as you register them after the graduation ceremony. Here's how to make sure that happens properly.

## Graduating Players Showcase

The game will show you a scrolling list of all graduating players with photo and stats.

![1][1]

![2][2]

## Registration Menu
Below is the menu for registering players. You can just select OK to finish here as they're already set up to be registered, but you should make sure their jersey name is set properly, or they won't have their name on the back of the jersey when you continue with them.

![3][3]
Choose the third menu option in the screen above to go to the player details on the right. Select each of the players in turn and follow the steps below for each.

![4][4]
Select the first name/jersey number menu option highlighted in the image above.

![5][5]
Select the next to last "back name" row shown in the image above. Enter the player's name using the controls that appear.

![6][6]
You can further configure the pronunciation of the player's name in the above screen. For standard Japanese names, the pitch accent should be set already, so you should be able to select OK without making changes.

![7][7]
Once you've set the name for each of your players, select OK from the top menu. You'll see the confirmation dialog shown in the image above. Select the button on the left to confirm.

![8][8]
The game will confirm that the players have been registered. You can now go to Star Player mode, for example, and find them there.
