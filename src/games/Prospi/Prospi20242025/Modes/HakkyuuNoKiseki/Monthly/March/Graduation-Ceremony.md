## 卒業
Every March, after the third semester, third-year students graduate and go out into the world to start whatever it is they want to do. In Hakkyuu no Kiseki, that means that they will improve the various town locations and maybe represent your high school in the pros!

### Ceremony

![graduation ceremony](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Monthly/March/Graduation/graduation-ceremony-dialog.png)

The graduation ceremony is held in the school gym with a nice banner on stage and a speech from the principal. Afterward, the club manager comes to you and sheds a little tear before moving on.

### Player Recap

After the ceremony, you'll get a recap of the graduating players with their new jobs and their playing stats from their high school careers.
