## 卒業
Every March, after the third semester, third-year students graduate and go out into the world to start whatever it is they want to do. In Hakkyuu no Kiseki, that means that they will improve the various town locations and maybe represent your high school in the pros! The graduation ceremony (卒業式) seems to be on the first Monday in March, so it could be anywhere from 3/1-3/7. Below, it's on March 2nd, 2026.

### Ceremony

![graduation ceremony][5]

The graduation ceremony is held in the school gym with a nice banner on stage and a speech from the principal. Afterward, the club manager comes to you and sheds a little tear before moving on.

### Town Updates

Graduating players go on to take jobs in the community which correspond to town locations and weekly activities. After graduation, you'll get updates on which town locations have been updated. The more players graduate and go to work in those locations, the higher the level of the location, and as the level increases, results from the activities at that location are stronger.
