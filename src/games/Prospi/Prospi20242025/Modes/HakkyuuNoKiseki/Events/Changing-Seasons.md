### Autumn
Koshien is over and the leaves are starting to turn. Won't be long until it's cold all the time and you'll be inside for the season.

![Autumn starting][3]
{% japanese %}秋の紅葉シーズンだ。<br />
がっしようじ物ん１１月から１２月上旬までが見どころのようだ 。
{% endjapanese %}

It's autumn, the season for changing leaves.
The best time to see the autumn leaves seems to be from November to early December.

### Winter
Finally, winter. Snowfall, all the leaves are gone, games are done for the year.

![Cold, snowy winter][4]
体の芯まで冷え込む日が増えてきた。
本格的に冬の到来だ。

The number of days when it feels cold to the core is increasing.

And so, winter has truly arrived.
