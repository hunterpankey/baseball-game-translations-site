This is still school, so of course your players have to go to classes and take exams and do other school stuff like that. Hopefully your players' academic levels are high enough that they don't fail classes and have to take remedial classes to catch up.

## Taking Exams

![Taking exams][1]
{% japanese %}今日は期末試験の日。<br />
日頃の勉強の成果が出る時だ。{% endjapanese %}

Today is final exam day.
It's time for all your hard work to pay off.

## Exam Results
![Finding out the results][2]
{% japanese %}湯浅と米本と助川は<br />
好成績を収めたようだ。{% endjapanese %}

Yuasa, Yonemoto and Sukegawa seem to have performed well.

![Relief that everyone passed][3]
{% japanese %}野球部から補習に呼ばれる部員はいなくて<br />
内心ホッとしている・・・{% endjapanese %}

I'm secretly relieved that no members of the baseball team were called in for remedial lessons...
