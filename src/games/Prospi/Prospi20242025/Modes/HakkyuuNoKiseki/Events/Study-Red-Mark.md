Sometimes it'll turn out that some of your players are not very good in school, getting bad grades, failing exams, and stuff like that. Here's what can happen.

## Getting the Red Mark
![1][1]
{% japanese "太田　美南" %}あっ、バーン監督!野球部から赤点ギリギリの生徒が何人か出ているみたいです。{% endjapanese %}

**(Club Manager) Minami Ota:** Ah, Coach Baun! It looks like there are a few students on the baseball team who are on the verge of failing.

{% japanese "太田　美南" %}・・・ということで今日は勉強会を開きますね!{% endjapanese %}

**Ota:** So, today we will be holding a study session!

![3][3]
{% japanese %}太田の一言で勉強会を開くことになった。<br />
誘われた3人はイヤイヤながらも<br />
仕方なく参加しているようだ。{% endjapanese %}

With just a word from Ohta, a study group was held. The three who were invited didn't want to, but had no choice but to show up.

## Results
