You can't run your players ragged without some negative effects. When players get tired, moods go down, and players don't improve as quickly as when they're well rested, so keep an eye on the fatigue levels of your players, and give them rest days and stamina drinks to help them get some energy back. If you don't, and you keep running practices flat out, this will happen.
