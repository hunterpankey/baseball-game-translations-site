Winning and losing games affects your school's fame level. You'll need to consistently play against teams that are stronger and more famous than yours to make progress. As your school gets more famous, you'll be able to scout and attract better players to your team.

## Raising Your School's Fame Level
![Notice that school fame increased to powerhouse][1]
{% japanese %}学校の評判が上がり強豪と呼ばれるようになった！{% endjapanese %}

The school's reputation has risen and it is now known as a powerhouse!

![Fame increase benefits: larger clubroom, better facilities][2]
{% japanese %}部費が増え学校グラウンドが黒土になった。<br />
部室が変更され少し広くなった。<br />
グラウンドのレベルが 4 0 になった。{% endjapanese %}

Club fees increased and the school grounds became black soil.
The clubroom was remodeled and made a little larger.
The grounds level became 40.

{% daisyAlert "Note: This change to black soil is because I hit the threshold of Grounds Level 40. If you haven't hit that level yet, you won't see that change, but the other changes will still take place. Just by leveling up the school fame, your grounds level will go up by some amount, and your practice results will get slightly better.", "info" %}

![Activity cards and max cost points increased to 10][3]
{% japanese %}コマンドアイコンの表示数が１０になった。コストの最大値が１０に上がった。{% endjapanese %}

The number of command icons displayed has increased to 10. The maximum cost has increased to 10.

{% daisyAlert "Note: Starting from 7 cards and 7 max cost points as a weak school, you'll go up by one each time. These screens show leveling up to 'Powerhouse', which is the third increase.", "info" %}

## Result
![New dashboard after the increases showing the new card and max cost point counts][4]

Here's the dashboard after increasing to Powerhouse. There are now 10 cards in the hand and 10 max cost points. Aside from the obvious benefit of being able to use higher cost cards, it's now more likely that you'll have doubles and be able to get the additional benefit of playing doubles with more cards available.
