Sometimes, the players get their act together and actually maintain the grounds and field. Hooray! This will happen randomly when an event occurs during practices/activities for the week.

## Possible Outcomes
- Grounds Level Increases - The grounds level will go up by some amount, possibly by multiple points.

## Standard Dialog
The following screens of dialog should be constant when the event occurs, except for the player doing the work.
![Tabata decides to help out](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Events/Grounds-Maintenance/player-grounds-maintenance-event-1.png)
> Tabata silently tackles the problem of maintaining the grounds.

![Other players notice and join in](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Events/Grounds-Maintenance/player-grounds-maintenance-event-2.png)
> Other players noticed and the grounds were carefully maintained.

## Variable Dialog
The following screen of dialog will vary based on what level you were at and how many levels it went up. Also, because the grounds are over level 40, the image shows black soil instead of white soil.

![Grounds level went up to 43](/assets/images/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/HakkyuNoKiseki/Events/Grounds-Maintenance/player-grounds-maintenance-event-3.png)
> The ground condition improved a bit. The grounds level went up to level 43.
