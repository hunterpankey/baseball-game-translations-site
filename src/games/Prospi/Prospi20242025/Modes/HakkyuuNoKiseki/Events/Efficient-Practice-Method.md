{% japanese "太田　美南" %}野村さんが<br />効率の良い練習方法を思い付いたみたいです！{% endjapanese %}

**(Club Manager) Minami Ota:** It looks like Nomura-kun has come up with an efficient practice method!

![2][2]

{% japanese "太田　美南" %}＊効率よく走塁する練習方法<br />
＊効率よく速球を投げる練習方法<br />
＊効率よく球威を上げる練習方法<br />
えーっと、確か・・・
{% endjapanese %}

**Ota:** Umm, I think...

The selections are, in order: Method to practice running the bases efficiently, method to practice throwing a fastball efficiently, method to practice increasing the power of your pitches efficiently

![3][3]
{% japanese "太田　美南" %}あっ、あ、そうそう！それです。<br />
効率よく球威を上げる練習方法って言っていました𝅘𝅥𝅮
{% endjapanese %}

**Ota:** Oh, that's right! That's it. 
He said it was a practice method to efficiently increase the pitch power.

{% daisyAlert "I clearly picked the third option, despite #2 being highlighted in the image above...", "info" %}

## Results
