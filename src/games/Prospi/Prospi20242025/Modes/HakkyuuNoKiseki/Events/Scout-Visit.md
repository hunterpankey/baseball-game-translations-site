Scouts will come to the school and watch practice from time to time. They usually come to see a specific player, and there is a chance to either perform well or perform poorly. This will be affected by the player's mood, and probably some other things.

## The Scout Visit
![Buzzing conversation among players about the visit][1]
{% japanese %}（ざわ、ざわ・・・）<br />
選手たちがザワついている。<br />
なんと今日はスカウトが練習を見に来ている！{% endjapanese %}

(buzzing conversation...) 
The players are all abuzz.
A scout has come to watch practice today!

![The scout is here to see Nomura][2]

{% japanese %}スカウトの視線が野村に注がれているようだ。{% endjapanese %}

It seems the scout's eyes are on Nomura.

## Results

### Bad Result
![Nomura didn't play well, so the scout rating didn't go up][3]
{% japanese %}野村はうまく実力をアピールできなかったようだ。<br />自信をなくした表情になっている・・・
{% endjapanese %}

It seems Nomura wasn't able to effectively demonstrate his abilities. 
He looks lacking in confidence...

### Good Result
If your player plays well in practice, their scout rating will increase, and they'll be in a better mood. You can check the scout rating (and the mood for that matter) in the [Smartphone's Roster screen](../../General/Dashboard-Smartphone/#smartphone), on the third page.
