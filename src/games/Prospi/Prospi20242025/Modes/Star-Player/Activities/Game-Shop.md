## Overview

On your activity day, you can choose one of a bunch of options, some of which only unlock after certain events or points in time. One of the activities available to select from the start is the video game shop. Here, you can buy games that then appear in your inventory. Later, during free time, you can choose to play the games you've purchased to gain skills or abilities. 

In the images below, I've gone shopping after the game. Let's take a look!

## Shopping at the Game Shop
![main activities selection menu][99]
From the activities menu (shown above), select the Game Shop activity, 「{% jishoSearch "ゲームショップ" %}」. This is located in the second row shop line, 「{% jisho "ショップ" %}」 on the left, in the same row with the video store, the game store, the CD store, and the sports store.

![starting the shopping activity][1]
{% japanese %}この後は何をしようか。本屋に行くことにした！{% endjapanese %}

What should I do next? I've decided to go to the game shop!

![the game shop shopping menu][2]

Unlike the bookstore where you don't need anything other than the book, here you have to buy the game system on the right to be able to play the games. That costs 10-man yen by itself. (A "man" is 10,000 in Japanese, so this is 100,000 yen, or about US$600, depending on the exchange rate.) Once purchased, the games are 8000 yen, which is about US$55.

In the image above, the first game on the left is selected:

**On the right side:**
{% japanese %}RPG ゲーム - 『カッパな毎日』 - 8000円 - 購入可能{% endjapanese %}

RPG Game - "{% link "Kappa", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kappa_(folklore)", true %} Everyday" - 8000 yen - Available for purchase

**In the status bar at the bottom:**
{% japanese %}使用することで進行度が進み、進行度が完了すると趣味熟練度、ステータスが上昇します。０個所持。あと１個購入可能。{% endjapanese %}

You can progress by using it, and when the progress is complete, your hobby proficiency and status will increase. 0 units owned. 1 available to purchase.

![buying the game system][3]

Here, I'm buying the game system itself on the right.

**On the right side:**
{% japanese %}最新ゲーム機 - １０万円 - 購入可能{% endjapanese %}

Latest Game System - 10-man yen - Available for purchase

**In the status bar at the bottom:**
{% japanese %}趣味に「ゲーム」が追加されます。０個所持。あと１個購入可能。{% endjapanese %}

"Games" will be added to your hobbies. 0 units owned. 1 available to purchase.

![completing the game system purchase][4]
Here you can see details about the purchase: how much money you have, how much you'll have after purchase, and the same item details on the right.

**Below is the confirmation:**
{% japanese %}最新ゲーム機を購入しますか？{% endjapanese %}

Do you want to buy the latest game system?

![purchase confirmation][7]
{% japanese %}最新ゲーム機を購入した！<br />
趣味に「ゲーム」が追加された！<br />
所持金が１０万円減った!{% endjapanese %}

Latest game system purchased!
"Games" has been added to my hobbies!
Money has decreased by 100,000 yen!

![shopping menu showing the item purchased][8]
Once purchased, the item shows a check mark instead of the price

![purchasing the Bio City game][9]
{% japanese %}『バイオシティー』を購入した！<br />
行動日・試合後に使用することで<br />
趣味熟練度を上げることができます。{% endjapanese %}

I bought "Bio City"! You can increase your hobby proficiency by using it on action days and after matches.

![spent 8000 yen on this game][10]
{% japanese %}所持金が８０００円減った！{% endjapanese %}

My money has decreased by 8,000 yen!

![purchased all video games][11]
Here, I've purchased all the games, because compared to other things, the games are pretty cheap at 8000 yen.

So that's the process. Later on, when you have an off day, you can play these games and get some progression and benefits. Details on that process will be published soon!
