## Overview

On your activity day, you can choose one of a bunch of options, some of which only unlock after certain events or points in time. One of the activities available to select from the start is the hamburger-restaurant. Here, you can buy books (obviously) that then appear in your inventory. Later, during free time, you can choose to read the books you've purchased to gain skills or abilities. 

In the images below, I've gone shopping after the game. Let's take a look!

## Eating at the Hamburger Restaurant
![main activities selection menu][99]
From the activities menu (shown above), select the hamburger restaurant activity, 「{% jisho "ハンバーガーレストラン" %}」. This is located in the third row restaurants line, 「{% jisho "飲食店" %}」 on the left. When you first start, only the hamburger restaurant and the beef bowl restaurant are available.

What should I eat today?

I didn't take a screen shot of the main selections, but they were: hamburger, cheeseburger, fish burger, rice burger, and stuff like that.

![drink selection menu][3]

After selecting the burger, you can select your drink. These options are nothing, juice, coffee, and black tea.

![order recap showing cheeseburger and juice][4]

I've decided to have a cheese burger and juice set.

![I enjoyed the meal][5]
{% japanese %}おいしい料理を堪能し、<br />
心身ともにリフレッシュすることができた。{% endjapanese %}

I enjoyed the delicious food and was able to refresh both my body and mind.

![fatigue and condition improved][6]

I've spent 1000 yen!
