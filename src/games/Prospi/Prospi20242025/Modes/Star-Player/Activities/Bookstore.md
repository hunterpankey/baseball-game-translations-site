## Overview

On your activity day, you can choose one of a bunch of options, some of which only unlock after certain events or points in time. One of the activities available to select from the start is the bookstore. Here, you can buy books (obviously) that then appear in your inventory. Later, during free time, you can choose to read the books you've purchased to gain skills or abilities. 

In the images below, I've gone shopping after the game. Let's take a look!

## Shopping at the Bookstore
![main activities selection menu][1]
From the activities menu (shown above), select the Bookstore activity, 「{% jisho "本屋-1", "本屋" %}」. This is located in the second row shop line, 「{% jisho "ショップ" %}」 on the left, in the same row with the video store, the game store, the CD store, and the sports store.

![starting the shopping activity][2]
{% japanese %}この後は何をしようか。本屋に行くことにした！{% endjapanese %}

What should I do next? I've decided to go to the bookstore!

**On the right side:**

**In the status bar at the bottom:**
{% japanese %}使用することで進行度が進み、進行度が完了すると趣味熟練度、ステータスが上昇します。０個所持。あと１個購入可能。{% endjapanese %}

Here you can see details about the purchase: how much money you have, how much you'll have after purchase, and the same item details on the right.

**Below is the confirmation:**

Do you want to buy the adventure novel "Grief Walker?"
