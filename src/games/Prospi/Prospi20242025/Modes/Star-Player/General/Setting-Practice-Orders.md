## Setting Practice Orders
Here's a typical practice orders screen. You'll tell the game what kind of practices you want to do, and how intense you want the practice sessions to be. Together with playing in games, this is how you'll do most of your player improvement in the Star Player Mode. 

![a typical practice orders screen with practices and intensity selected][1]

Here's what we see on the screen:
1. **Buttons in the top left:** OK saves the changes, and reset ({% jisho "リセット" %}) reverts your changes to the way they were when you arrived at the page.
2. **Practice selections:** Below the buttons are the three practice selections that your player will perform in each practice period. I have "Physical", "Special Batting Skills", and "Special Fielding Skills" selected right now.
3. **Practice options:** To the right of the selections are other practice options. To change them, select the item on the left you want to replace and press X, then select the new practice on the right with X. You can only practice a type once in the selections, i.e., you can't do triple-power to hurry that up. You can select from the following:
  - Contact vs. Right Handed Pitchers ({% jishoSearch "対右ミート" %})
  - Contact vs. Left Handed Pitchers ({% jishoSearch "対左ミート" %})
  - Power ({% jisho "パワー" %})
  - Running Speed ({% jisho "走力" %})
  - Glove Skills ({% jisho "捕球" %})
  - Throwing Accuracy ({% jisho "スローイング" %})
  - Shoulder Strength/Throwing Power ({% jisho "肩" %}-{% jisho "力" %})
  - Fielding ({% jisho "守備" %}) - Select the position to practice after selecting this.
  - Special Batting Skills ({% jisho "特別打撃" %})
  - Special Fielding Skills ({% jisho "特別守備" %})
  - Physical ({% jisho "フィジカル" %})
  - General Practice ({% jisho "総合練習" %})

4. **Practice intensity and fatigue:** You can select how intense you work out, with more intense workouts leading to greater gains but also making your player more tired.
![the fatigue-intensity block on the practice page][2]
In the block above, I have the middle intensity level selected. Below, I have zero fatigue, which gives me the very happy mood. As days go by and fatigue accumulates, mood will decrease. Below the fatigue and mood bar is 「{% jishoSearch "10試合経過時の疲労目安" %}」, telling me that after 10 games, I'll accumulate 15% fatigue. Through other means, the player can get into better fitness levels so that higher intensity practices and playing in games doesn't fatigue the player as much.
1. **Practice intensity options:** You can choose how strong to practice, affecting the practice benefits and fatigue accumulation.
![intensity selections][3]
In order:
* Watch practice only: no benefits and no fatigue
* Light practice: low benifits and low fatigue
* Normal practice: normal levels of both
* Strong practice: high levels of both

## Other Parts of the Screen
You can see the player details on the right side. This view is everywhere in the game, showing the name, photo, and letter grade for each of the skill areas and defensive positions played.

### Additional Controls
* Press the left half of the touchpad to show additional pages of details about the player, cycling through skill levels, basic stats.
* Press triangle to show the player's recent skill changes:
