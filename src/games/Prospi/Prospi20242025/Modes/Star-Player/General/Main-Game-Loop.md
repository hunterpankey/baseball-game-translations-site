## Overview

Star Player mode lets you take control of the life of a professional NPB baseball player, either a brand new player, one that you've created from another mode like Hakkyuu no Kiseki, or a real life player from one of the 12 NPB teams. You'll play in the games, select which practices to do, and who to befriend.

## The Game Loop
Here's what you should be doing on a weekly (in-game) basis.

### Update Practice Settings
You can choose which skills to work on in weekly practice, from contact batting to baserunning to special skills. You'll need to manage which three skills to practice in the week as well has how vigorously you want to practice. Make sure you manage your overall fatigue level. Higher fatigue affects how well you play, how effective your practices are, and whether you get injured.

### Social Life
You should be spending time with the various people that you meet, including manager and coaches, teammates, opposing players, other people associated with your team, and other friends and acquaintences. By spending time with them, you'll improve your relationship with them and get better effects. For example, having a good relationship with your manager lets you request changes to the lineup and fielding positions, letting you hit where you want.

### Use Enhancement and Recovery Items
If you're tired, use a recovery item to get back in high-energy form. You'll perform better on the field and improve your skills at a faster page than if you're tired all the time. Go shopping on your day off to get recovery items, or spend time with an acquaintance who will give you some.

### Playing Games
Of course, you'll be playing in games for your team in this mode. You have plenty of options for how to progress through games. You can play them yourself or skip them, and while playing the game, you can choose how much you want to play in the field or run the bases, from none at all to every single pitch. Do well in the games to improve your skills and become an even better player.
