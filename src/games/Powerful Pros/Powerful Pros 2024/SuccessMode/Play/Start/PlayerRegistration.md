## Team Selection
![Team Selection menu](/assets/images/games/PowerfulPros/2024/SuccessMode/Play/Start/PlayerRegistration/3.png)

In "Pro Baseball 12 Team" mode, Pawa Pro 24 contains scenarios for each of the twelve NPB teams. The first step in registration is to select your team. This site will show the Chunichi Dragons scenario. You can see the team name above the scenario name in the center of the screen. *Pictured: Chunichi Dragons with the "Veteran Qualifications" scenario (べテランの資格).*

Player registration data has been set. Are you sure you want to confirm?

## Player Audio Selection

The game has many audio clips of the announcers pronouncing names. You can select one of these names, and the announcers will call your player that name during games.

![Confirmation dialog](/assets/images/games/PowerfulPros/2024/SuccessMode/Play/Start/PlayerRegistration/6.png)

Enter characters for the name you want the announcers to call you. As you enter characters, the total results will decrease. When characters have been entered, select "OK" to show a list of matching player name audio. The number of audio clips matching the characters is shown below the name entry.

## General Player Information
![Handedness selection options](/assets/images/games/PowerfulPros/2024/SuccessMode/Play/Start/PlayerRegistration/8a.png)
Before confirming, check your player's handedness (利き腕), position (守備位置), batting stance (フォーム), and set the difficulty level (ゲームレベル).

### Handedness
![Handedness selection options](/assets/images/games/PowerfulPros/2024/SuccessMode/Play/Start/PlayerRegistration/8.png)
Choose whether your player throws left or right handed, and whether your player bats left handed, right handed, or switch hits. *Pictured: Right handed throwing, right handed hitting*

左 - left
右 - right
満 - switch
投 - throwing
打 - batting

## Points Allocation
### Omakase vs. Manual Points Allocation
![Omakase vs. manual points allocation dialog](/assets/images/games/PowerfulPros/2024/SuccessMode/Play/Start/PlayerRegistration/9.png)
Omakase allocation (pictured), will start the allocation with 20 rank points allocated for each of the main six categories and consumes the points needed to allocate them. Manual allocation starts everything at 1, but starts you with all the available points to allocate.

### Allocating Points
![Point allocation interface](/assets/images/games/PowerfulPros/2024/SuccessMode/Play/Start/PlayerRegistration/10.png)
Along the top, your player has several ranks and attributes. From the left, the star rating is an overall aggregation of all the other ranks and points for quickly comparing against other characters. The second column indicates the tendency to hit fly balls. The next six columns are, "meet" (contact), "power", "speed", "shoulder strength" (throwing), "defense", and "ball catching". Defense affects reaction time and getting to balls in the field, and ball catching affects how frequently the player makes a glove error on defense.

The points below represent the raw points to allocate to the attributes above. In addition to directly affecting the fly ball tendency and the six major attributes, you can allocate points to special quirks and characteristics, or you can add additional secondary defensive positions.

The tabs between the attribute points and the allocation zone are, (in order), "fielder basics", "fielder characteristics", "pitcher basics", "pitcher characteristics", and "other".

The initial raw points allocation will get you to about 75-80 stars, and events in the story will give you additional raw points to allocate to attribute points and characteristics.

## Succession Player Deck

![Player registration and deck](/assets/images/games/PowerfulPros/2024/SuccessMode/Play/Start/PlayerRegistration/11.png)
*Ed. Note: So far, I'm speculating as to the function of this screen. "Candidate" players are shown in the right column and can be selected or registered into your player deck by selecting one of the slots in the middle column, then selecting the player to register from the candidate column.

## Special Items and Talismans

![Special items](/assets/images/games/PowerfulPros/2024/SuccessMode/Play/Start/PlayerRegistration/12.png)
If you have special items available (from the Pawa Puro shop on the main menu), you can take one to assist you.

### Confirmation
![Confirming special item usage](/assets/images/games/PowerfulPros/2024/SuccessMode/Play/Start/PlayerRegistration/13.png)
Confirm the usage of the special item with "OK". The special item will be consumed, so you'll have to buy another one from the shop if you want to use it again.

## Completion
After confirming the special item or not selecting one, registration is complete, and the scenario will start directly.
