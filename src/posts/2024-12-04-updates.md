<article class="prose max-w-xl lg:max-w-4xl lg:prose-lg">
Some helpful (hopefully) updates in this one, but this is a slightly smaller update than others because I've actually been playing more.

I keep waiting for patches to fix some in-game stuff that I hate, namely that outfielders can just straight-up hose guys on the bases because outfield throws to 3rd and home are never offline, always perfectly to the base, which is ridiculous. I also really don't like how bad the infield defense AI is. I had a catcher just post up at the plate instead of grabbing a bunt that was one step away, waiting for the pitcher to get to it. Just completely braindead AI... So I've been watching patch notes pretty closely, and I decided to post a couple of recent translations. I'll try to get them up on the site pretty soon after they arrive.

Thinking about starting another mode sometime soon. I'm leaning toward star player, but maybe My Ballpark. I still want to play in games, so most likely one of those. OK, have fun out there!
