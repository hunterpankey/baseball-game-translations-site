<article class="prose max-w-xl lg:max-w-4xl lg:prose-lg">
I started the Star Player mode a couple of days ago and have a couple of pages ready to go.

## New Pages
* [Star Player - Main Game Loop](/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/Modes/Star-Player/General/Main-Game-Loop/)
* [Star Player - Star Player Settings](/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/Modes/Star-Player/General/Star-Player-Settings/)
* [Star Player - Practice Settings](/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/Modes/Star-Player/General/Setting-Practice-Orders/)
* [6th Survey News Translation](/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/General/Updates/2024-12-17-6th-Survey/)

There's still a bunch of stuff that I don't know about Star Player mode, so by all means, check my info and correct me if there's something wrong or let me know more details about how something works if something needs to be added. I'll be adding more as I play more and find out more. Have fun out there!
