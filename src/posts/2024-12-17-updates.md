<article class="prose max-w-xl lg:max-w-4xl lg:prose-lg">
Just a little update this time as I've been playing more and doing other stuff recently.

## New Pages
* [Hakkyuu no Kiseki - Business Center Activity](/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/Modes/HakkyuuNoKiseki/Activities/Business-Center/)
* [5th Survey News Translation](/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/General/Updates/2024-12-09-5th-Survey/)
* [Update 1.4.0 News Translation](/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/General/Updates/2024-12-17-Update-1.4.0/)

## Updated Pages
* [Tournament Lifecycle](/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/Modes/HakkyuuNoKiseki/Gameplay/Tournament-Bracket-Selection/) - Added information arount the overall tournament sequence and what happens when you win a tournament
* And misc typos and misspellings...

I started Star Player mode last night with one of my Hakkyuu no Kiseki graduates, a 430-star LF that mashes taters. Fun so far! I'll probably write up some of it to help y'all out getting started there.
