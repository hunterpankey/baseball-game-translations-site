Pro Yakyuu Spirits 2024-2025 is finally released! I see folks playing on Steam and PS5 already, but I just realized that I chose economy shipping from Play Asia, so my PS5 disc will probably be on a boat for a couple of weeks.

## Stuff

For now, there are folks streaming on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/pro-yakyuu-spirits-2024-2025" target="_blank">Twitch</a>, so I'll watch some of them and see if I can avoid getting so excited that I try the VPN-foreign-currency method to buy it a second time. Also, there's a wonderful community translation site for menus at <a href="https://prospitranslation.wixsite.com/2024" target="_blank">Prospi Translation</a>. Have a look if you're playing too and I haven't posted what you're looking for.

OK, friends, have fun out there!
