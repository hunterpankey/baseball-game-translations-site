<article class="prose max-w-xl lg:max-w-4xl lg:prose-lg">
Lots of little event and activity pages have been created based on a bunch of screenshots I took from my playthrough. I'm up to September 2026 in my HK playthrough. I won the prefectural tournament in the summer and went to Koshien, but lost in the first game to a team that wasn't really better than my team, after beating a much better team in the prefectural finals. Oh well, c'est la vie!

## Better Functionality
* I started adding badges to pages in the [Prospi 2024 HK](/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/Modes/HakkyuuNoKiseki) index page to show new and updated pages. I'll clear 'em all when I write a new blog post with updates. It won't be super-regular, so if you're not checking in regularly, you'll miss something. Not the end of the world, though.
* I updated the styles for pages with dialogs or translations to show the original Japanese in [Noto Sans JP](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+JP), which I think is the font the game uses. It's also in a dark slate background and larger font reminiscent of the way the game renders text in dialogs so you can read it ok. (By the way, if you install and configure a nice Japanese dictionary addon like "[Yomitan](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan#yomitan)" or something like that, you can see pronunciations, definitions, and kanji meanings in an overlay directly in the browser.)

## Updated Pages
* Added 「名門」 characters to the top fame level description in [Fame Levels](/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/Modes/HakkyuuNoKiseki/General/Fame-Levels/). I'll probably delete this page and just leave them in the [Lists](/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/Modes/HakkyuuNoKiseki/General/Lists/) page.
* Added mood icon images in [Lists](/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/Modes/HakkyuuNoKiseki/General/Lists/)
* Added Batting Trajectories descriptions and text in [Lists](/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/Modes/HakkyuuNoKiseki/General/Lists/)
* Added the Toolbox item to the [Items](/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/Modes/HakkyuuNoKiseki/General/Items/) page.
