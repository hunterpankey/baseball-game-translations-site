I hope this stuff is helping you play! Feel free to send in requests for information. Eventually I'd like to cover more modes like Star Player and Season mode. Someday, I might even try My Ballpark. Seriously, there are so many awesome single-player modes in Prospi this time around!

If you're having trouble, the community over in the [ProSpi Translation Discord](https://discord.gg/pVGaPXYVRq) is really helpful, and [TheGreatMuta's ProSpiTranslation guide](https://prospitranslation.wixsite.com/2024) is amazing!

Anyway, enjoy!
