Star Player mode continues apace! I'm still learning a lot about it, but I have some good updates here.

## New Pages
* [Star Player - Official In-game Help](/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/Modes/Star-Player/General/Official-Help/)
* [Star Player - Bookstore Activity](/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/Modes/Star-Player/Activities/Bookstore/)
* [Star Player - Game Shop Activity](/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/Modes/Star-Player/Activities/Game-Shop/)
* [Star Player - Hamburger Restaurant Activity](/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/Modes/Star-Player/Activities/Hamburger-Restaurant/)
* [Star Player - Main Dashboard Explanation](/games/Prospi/Prospi20242025/Modes/Star-Player/General/Dashboard/)

## Updates
* I started pulling out the city images from the date/travel cards and updated some of the existing SP pages with new images.

I probably need to bump up the difficulty. I'm hitting .500 with 20 HR in April. Fun to hit bombs, though!
